                Since April 1, 2021, the scheme has been replaced by a subsidy. If you are not yet using the scheme, you can no longer claim it. Are you already using the scheme? Nothing will change for you and the scheme will remain valid for a maximum of 15 years after the commencement date.",
            "energy_discount" => "The promotional conditions state when you will receive the discount. In most cases, the discount is deducted from the energy costs you pay in the first year. You can find this on the annual accounts. To give you a complete picture of the costs, we show you monthly amounts here that already include the cashback",

The rates shown are certainly up to and including {{date}}. This means that they will not increase during that period. If the rates change, the annual costs will be different than shown here. You will be notified by the supplier when rates change.",
